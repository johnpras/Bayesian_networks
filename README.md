Basic code for a Bayesian Network. Includes calculating the Conditional Probability Tables, doing inferences between nodes, predicting the next node and creating a confusion matrix to evaluate the trained model.

Categorical naive bayes was used, hence the code is working with an excel/csv sheet in categorical form (0,1).
